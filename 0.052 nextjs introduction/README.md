# 0.052 Next.js Introduction

## What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications easier and more efficient. Think of it as React with superpowers! While React is a library for building user interfaces, Next.js is a framework that provides additional structure, tools, and features to help you build complete web applications.

## Why Use Next.js Over Plain React?

### React Alone

When you use React by itself, you need to:

- Set up routing manually
- Handle server-side rendering yourself
- Optimize for performance manually
- Configure build tools
- Set up development environment

### Next.js Benefits

Next.js handles all of this for you and provides:

- **Built-in routing** - Just create files and folders
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and performance
- **Static site generation (SSG)** - Lightning-fast websites
- **API routes** - Backend functionality in the same project
- **Image optimization** - Automatic image compression
- **CSS support** - Built-in styling options
- **TypeScript support** - Optional but built-in
- **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box

## Real-World Analogy

Think of building a house:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** = Raw materials (wood, nails, paint)
- **React** = Tools (hammer, saw, paintbrush)
- **Next.js** = Complete construction kit with blueprints, pre-made parts, and expert guidance

## Key Features Explained

### 1. File-Based Routing

```text
pages/
  index.js       ‚Üí yoursite.com/
  about.js       ‚Üí yoursite.com/about
  blog/
    index.js     ‚Üí yoursite.com/blog
    [slug].js    ‚Üí yoursite.com/blog/any-post-name
```

### 2. Pre-rendering

- **Static Generation (SSG)**: Pages built at build time
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pages built on each request
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Traditional React approach

### 3. API Routes

Create backend APIs in the same project:

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello from Next.js!" });
}
```

### 4. Image Optimization

```javascript
import Image from "next/image";

function Profile() {
  return <Image src="/profile.jpg" alt="Profile" width={500} height={500} />;
}
```

## When to Use Next.js

### Perfect For

- **E-commerce websites** (better SEO)
- **Blogs and content sites** (static generation)
- **Company websites** (professional performance)
- **Web applications** (full-stack capabilities)
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**

### Maybe Not Needed For

- Simple static websites
- Learning React basics
- Very simple projects
- Projects with specific build requirements

## Learning Path

### Prerequisites (You Should Know)

1. ‚úÖ HTML/CSS basics
2. ‚úÖ JavaScript fundamentals
3. ‚úÖ React basics (components, props, state)
4. ‚úÖ Node.js basics (helpful but not required)

### What We'll Learn

1. **Installation and Setup**
2. **Project Structure**
3. **Pages and Routing**
4. **Components in Next.js**
5. **Styling Options**
6. **Basic Data Fetching**
7. **Building and Deployment**

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Create Next App (Recommended)

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

### Method 2: Manual Setup

```bash
mkdir my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm init -y
npm install next react react-dom
```

Then add to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

## Project Structure

```text
my-nextjs-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _app.js        # Custom App component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js       # Home page
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about.js       # About page

// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      <p>This is your first Next.js page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next.js vs React Comparison

| Feature     | React                  | Next.js               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Routing     | Manual setup needed    | File-based routing    |
| SEO         | Client-side rendering  | Server-side rendering |
| Performance | Manual optimization    | Built-in optimization |
| Setup       | Complex configuration  | Zero configuration    |
| Backend     | Separate server needed | Built-in API routes   |
| Deployment  | Manual process         | Optimized builds      |

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Hot reloading
- Error reporting
- Development optimizations

### Production Mode

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

- Optimized bundles
- Minified code
- Performance optimizations

## Next Steps
