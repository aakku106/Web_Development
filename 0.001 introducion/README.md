# Website Components

- **Web Pages:** A web page is a **digital document** containing text, images, videos, and links, displayed in a **web browser** like Chrome or Firefox.  
- **Building Blocks:** Websites are made up of **web pages**, which are developed by web developers using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, or sometimes frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**.  
- **Client-side (Frontend):** The **interface you see in your browser** is called the **frontend** or **client-side** of a website. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and similar technologies are used to build the frontend.  
- **Backend (Server-side):** This is the part of the website that **handles, processes, and stores requests**. The backend is the **main part of a website** and is also called the **server-side**. Technologies used include **Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Go, SQL**, and more.

# How a Website Works

- **Request:** When you visit a webpage, your browser sends a **request to the server (backend)**.  
- **Response:** The server **processes the request**, accesses necessary data, and **sends a response** back to the client, usually as an HTML file or JSON data.  
- **Database:** Website data is stored in a **database**. There are two main types:  
  - **SQL Databases:** Store data in **tables and structured queries**.  
  - **NoSQL Databases:** Store data in **flexible formats**, not limited to tables.
