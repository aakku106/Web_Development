# CSS Introduction

# What is CSS?
CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

- **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.
- CSS describes how **HTML elements** are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
- CSS **saves a lot of work** by controlling the layout of multiple web pages at once.
- **External stylesheets** are stored in **CSS files**.

# Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

### CSS Example

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
# CSS Saves a Lot of Work!

The CSS definitions are normally saved in an external .css file.

With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
