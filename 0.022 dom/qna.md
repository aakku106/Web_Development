# JavaScript DOM Practice Set

This practice set focuses on areas that were missing or lightly covered in the previous DOM lesson.

---

### Question 1: Dynamic Element Creation

Create a button and an empty `<ul>` in HTML. When the button is clicked, read a value from an input field and **add it as a new `<li>`** inside the `<ul>`.

### Question 2: Class Toggling

Select an element with a class `.box`. When a button is clicked, **toggle another class** that changes its background color or border.

### Question 3: Remove Element

Create a list of `<li>` items. Each item has a **remove button**. When clicked, **delete that particular `<li>`**.

### Question 4: Iterate Over Multiple Elements

Select all `<p>` elements inside a container using `querySelectorAll`. Change the **text color** or **font style** of each paragraph using a loop.

### Question 5: Form Validation

Create a form with **username** and **email** fields. On submission, **check if fields are empty** and show an alert or display a warning div if validation fails.

### Question 6: Form Data Display

Create a form with **name, age, and email**. On submission, **collect all values** and display them in a formatted sentence inside a `<div>`.

### Question 7: Event Handling

Create an input field for a number and a button. On button click, **dynamically create that many `<div>` boxes** on the page, numbered sequentially.

### Question 8: Advanced Selector Practice

* Use `getElementsByTagName` to select all `<h2>` elements and change their text.
* Use `getElementsByClassName` to select elements with a certain class and add a style.
* Use `querySelector` to select a single element inside a nested div and modify it.
* Use `querySelectorAll` to select multiple nested elements and modify them in a loop.

These exercises will help you practice **dynamic DOM manipulation**, **class toggling**, **form handling**, and **iterating over multiple elements**, which were partially missing in the main lesson.
