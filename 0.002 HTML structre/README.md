# Introduction to HTML

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.
It is used to **insert text, elements, images**, etc. into a webpage.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: HTML is **not** a programming language; it is a **markup language**.

Here‚Äôs a basic HTML program that prints `Hello, World!` on the screen:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello, World!
  </body>
</html>
```

## Explanation:

- `<!DOCTYPE html`> ‚Üí Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.

- `<html>` ‚Üí Root element that encloses all HTML elements.

- `<head>` ‚Üí Contains meta-information (title, stylesheets, scripts).

- `<title>` ‚Üí Title of the web page (shown in the browser‚Äôs title bar/tab).

- `<body>` ‚Üí Contains the visible content (text, images, links, etc.).

Here‚Äôs the labeled output with tags:

# Comments in HTML

Comments exist in **every programming language**.
They are ignored by the **compiler/interpreter** and used by programmers to **describe code without affecting the output**.

In HTML, we write comments using `<!-- ... -->`.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    Hello, World!
  </body>
</html>
```


üëâ The line `<!-- This is a comment -->` will be ignored, and only `Hello, World!` will be shown.
