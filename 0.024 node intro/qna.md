## 1. Hello Node

Create a Node.js program that prints "Hello, Node.js World!" in the console.

## 2. Simple HTTP Response

Create a server that responds with "Welcome to My Node Server" when accessed on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 3. Custom Port Server

Modify the server to run on **port 5000** instead of 3000 and verify it works.

## 4. Respond with JSON

Create a server that returns a JSON object `{"name": "John", "age": 20}` instead of plain text.

## 5. Logging Requests

Create a server that logs the **requested URL** to the console every time a user visits a route.

## 6. Multiple Routes

Create a server that responds differently for two routes:

* `/` → "Home Page"
* `/about` → "About Page"

## 7. Reading Files

Create a server that reads a file `data.txt` and sends its content as a response when accessed.
