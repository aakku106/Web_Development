# JavaScript OOP Practice Set

### Question 1: Create a Class and Object

Create a class called `Person` with properties `name` and `age`. Make an object of this class and display the values using a method.

**Expected Output:**

```
Name: Pramish
Age: 13
```

---

### Question 2: Use Constructor

Create a class `Book` with a constructor that accepts `title` and `author`. Display both values using a function `showInfo()`.

**Expected Output:**

```
Book: Atomic Habits
Author: James Clear
```

---

### Question 3: Encapsulation (Private Variable)

Create a class `BankAccount` with a private variable `#balance`. Add a method `deposit(amount)` and `getBalance()`.

**Expected Output:**

```
Deposited: 1000
Current Balance: 1000
```

---

### Question 4: Inheritance

Create a parent class `Animal` with method `sound()` and a child class `Cat` that extends `Animal` and overrides `sound()`.

**Expected Output:**

```
Cat meows
```

---

### Question 5: Polymorphism

Create a parent class `Shape` with a method `area()`. Then create `Square` and `Circle` classes that extend `Shape` and define their own `area()` methods.

**Expected Output:**

```
Area of Square: 25
Area of Circle: 78.5
```

---

### Question 6: Abstraction

Create a class `CoffeeMachine` that hides the process of heating water inside a private method `#heatWater()` and exposes only a public method `makeCoffee()`.

**Expected Output:**

```
Heating water...
Coffee ready!
```

---

### Question 7: Combining All OOP Concepts

Create a program that uses all four OOP principles:

* A parent class `Vehicle` (encapsulation + abstraction)
* A subclass `Car` (inheritance)
* A method `move()` that behaves differently (polymorphism)

**Expected Output:**

```
Car engine started
Vehicle is moving
Car is running smoothly!
```
